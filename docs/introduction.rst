ScanCode.io Overview
====================

**ScanCode.io** is a server to script and automate the process of
**Software Composition Analysis (SCA)** to identify any open source components
and their license compliance data in an applicationâ€™s codebase. ScanCode.io can be
used for various use cases, such as Docker container and VM composition
analyses, among other applications.

Why ScanCode.io?
----------------

Modern software is built from many open source packages assembled with new code.
Knowing which free and open source code package is in use matters because:

- You're required to **know the license of third-party code** before using it, and
- You want to avoid using buggy, outdated or vulnerable components.

It's usually convenient to include and reuse new code downloaded from the
internet; however, it's often surprisingly hard to get a proper inventory of
all third-party code origins and licenses used in a software project.
There are some great tools available to scan your code and help uncover these
details. For example, when you reuse only a few FOSS components in a single
project, running one of these tools, such as the **ScanCode-toolkit**, manually
along with a spreadsheet might be enough to manage your software composition
analysis.

However, when you scale up, running automated and reproducible analysis pipelines
that are adapted to a software project's unique context and technology platform
can be difficult. This will require deploying and running multiple specialized
tools and merge their results with a consistent workflow. Moreover,
when reusing thousands of open source packages is becoming commonplace,
code scans pipelines need to be scripted as code is running on servers backed
by a shared database, not on a laptop.

For instance, when you analyze Docker container images, there could be hundreds
to thousands of system packages, such as Debian, RPM, Alpine, and application
packages, including npm, PyPI, Rubygems, Maven, installed in an image
side-by-side with your own code. Taking care of all this can be
an extremely hard task, and that's when **ScanCode.io** comes into play to help
organizing these complex code analysis as scripted pipelines and store their
results in a database for automated code analysis.

What is ScanPipe?
-----------------

**ScanPipe** is a developer-friendly framework and application that helps
software analysts and engineers build and manage real-life software composition
analysis projects as scripted pipelines.

**ScanPipe** provides a unified framework to the infrastructure that is
required to execute and organize these software composition analysis projects.

Should I use ScanPipe?
----------------------

If you are working on a software composition analysis project, or you
are planning to start a new one, consider the following questions:

1. **Automation**: Is the project part of a larger compliance program
   (as opposed to a one-of) and that you require automation?
2. **Complexity**: Does the project use many third-party components or technologies?
3. **Reproducibility**: Is it important that the results are reproducible, traceable,
   and auditable?

If you answered **"yes"** to any of the above, keep reading - ScanPipe can help
you. If the answer is **"no"** to all of the above, which is a valid scenario,
e.g., when you are doing small-scale analysis, ScanPipe may provide only limited
benefit for you.

The first set of available pipelines helps automate the analysis of Docker
container images and virtual machine (VM) disk images that often harbor
comprehensive software stacks from an operating system with its kernel through
system and application packages to original and custom applications.

Dependencies and Internal Tools
-------------------------------

ScanCode.io is essentially a `Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_-based
application wrapper around the
`ScanCode Toolkit <https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit>`_ scanning engine.

The **Django framework** is leveraged for many aspects of ScanCode.io:

- :ref:`user_interface`
- :ref:`rest_api`
- :ref:`command_line_interface`
- :ref:`data_model`

.. note::
    Multiple applications from the Django eco-system are also included,
    see the `setup.cfg <https://github.com/nexB/scancode.io/blob/main/setup.cfg>`_ file
    for an exhaustive list of dependencies.

The second essential part of ScanCode.io is the **ScanCode Toolkit**, which is used
for archives extraction and as the scanning engine.

The nexB `container-inspector <https://github.com/nexB/container-inspector>`_ library
is also a key component of ScanCode.io as this tool is used to analyse Docker
images, containers, root filesystems, and virtual machine images.

.. note::
    As a common practice, ScanCode.io releases usually follow ScanCode Toolkit releases
    to ensure the latest improvements of the scanning engines are included in the
    latest release of ScanCode.io.
