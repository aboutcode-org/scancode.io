ScanPipe Concepts
=================

Project
-------

A **project** encapsulates the analysis of software code:

- It has a **workspace**, which is a directory that contains the software code
  files under analysis.
- It makes use of one or more **code analysis pipelines** scripts to automate
  the code analysis process.
- It tracks ``Codebase Resources``, i.e. its **code files and directories**
- It tracks ``Discovered Packages``, i.e. **system and application packages**
  origin and license discovered in the codebase.

In the database, **a project is identified by its unique name**.

.. note::
    Multiple analysis pipelines can be run on a single project.

.. _Project workspace:

Project workspace
-----------------

A project workspace is the root directory where **a project's files are stored**.

The following directories exist under the workspace directory:

- :guilabel:`input/` contains all uploaded files used as the input of a project,
  such as a codebase archive.
- :guilabel:`codebase/` contains files and directories - i.e. resources -
  tracked as CodebaseResource records in the database.
- :guilabel:`output/` contains any output files created by the pipelines,
  including reports, scan results, etc.
- :guilabel:`tmp/` is a scratch pad for temporary files generated during
  pipelines runs.

.. _pipelines_concept:

Pipelines
---------

A pipeline is a Python script that contains a series of steps, which are
executed sequentially to **perform a code analysis**.

It usually starts with the uploaded input files, which might need to be
extracted first. Then, it generates ``CodebaseResource`` records in the database
accordingly.

Those resources can then be **analyzed, scanned, and matched** as needed.
Analysis results and reports are eventually posted at the end of a pipeline run.

All :ref:`built_in_pipelines` are located in the ``scanpipe.pipelines`` module.
Each pipeline consists of a Python script and includes one subclass of the
``Pipeline`` class.
Each step is a method of the ``Pipeline`` class.
The execution order of the steps - or the sequence of steps execution - is
declared through the ``steps`` class attribute.

.. tip::
    Refer to :ref:`custom_pipelines` for adding pipelines to ScanCode.io.

.. note::
    One or more pipelines can be assigned to a project as a sequence.

Codebase Resources
------------------

A project ``Codebase Resources`` are records of its **code files and directories**.
``CodebaseResource`` is a database model and each record is identified by its path
under the project workspace.

The following are some of the ``CodebaseResource`` attributes:

- A **status**, which is used to track the analysis status for this resource.
- A **type**, such as a file, a directory or a symlink
- Various attributes to track detected **copyrights**, **license expressions**,
  **copyright holders**, and **related packages**.

.. note::
    Please note that `ScanCode-toolkit <https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit>`_
    use the same attributes and attribute names for files.

Discovered Packages
-------------------

A project ``Discovered Packages`` are records of the **system and application packages**
discovered in the code unedr analysis.
``DiscoveredPackage`` is a database model and each record is identified by its ``Package URL``.
``Package URL`` is a fundamental effort to create informative identifiers for
software packages, such as Debian, RPM, npm, Maven, or PyPI packages.
See https://github.com/package-url for more details.

The following are some of the ``DiscoveredPackage`` attributes:

- A type, name, version (all Package URL attributes)
- A homepage_url, download_url, and other URLs
- Checksums, such as SHA1, MD5
- Copyright, license_expression, and declared_license

.. note::
    Please note that `ScanCode-toolkit <https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit>`_
    use the same attributes and attribute names for packages.
