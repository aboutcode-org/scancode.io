.. _command_line_interface:

Command Line Interface
======================

A ``scanpipe`` command can be executed through the ``docker compose`` command line
interface with::

    docker compose exec -it web scanpipe COMMAND

Alternatively, you can start a ``bash`` session in a new Docker container to execute
multiple ``scanpipe`` commands::

    docker compose run web bash
    scanpipe COMMAND
    scanpipe COMMAND
    ...

.. warning::
    In order to add local input files to a project using the Command Line Interface,
    extra arguments need to be passed to the ``docker compose`` command.

    For instance ``--volume /path/on/host:/target/path/in/container:ro``
    will mount and make available the host path inside the container (``:ro`` stands
    for read only).

    .. code-block:: bash

        docker compose run --volume /home/sources:/sources:ro \
            web scanpipe create-project my_project --input-file="/sources/image.tar"

.. note::
    In a local development installation, the ``scanpipe`` command is directly
    available as an entry point in your virtualenv and is located at
    ``<scancode.io_root_dir>/bin/scanpipe``.

`$ scanpipe --help`
-------------------

Lists all sub-commands available, including Django built-in commands.
ScanPipe's own commands are listed under the ``[scanpipe]`` section::

    $ scanpipe --help
    ...
    [scanpipe]
        add-input
        add-pipeline
        archive-project
        create-project
        delete-project
        execute
        graph
        list-project
        output
        show-pipeline
        status


`$ scanpipe <subcommand> --help`
--------------------------------

Displays help for the provided sub-command.

For example::

    $ scanpipe create-project --help
    usage: scanpipe create-project [--input-file INPUTS_FILES]
        [--input-url INPUT_URLS] [--pipeline PIPELINES] [--execute] [--async]
        name

    Create a ScanPipe project.

    positional arguments:
      name                  Project name.


`$ scanpipe create-project <name>`
----------------------------------

Creates a ScanPipe project using ``<name>`` as a Project name. The project name
must be unique.

Optional arguments:

- ``--pipeline PIPELINES`` Pipelines names to add on the project.

- ``--input-file INPUTS_FILES`` Input file locations to copy in the :guilabel:`input/`
  work directory.

- ``--input-url INPUT_URLS`` Input URLs to download in the :guilabel:`input/` work
  directory.

- ``--execute`` Execute the pipelines right after project creation.

- ``--async`` Add the pipeline run to the tasks queue for execution by a worker instead
  of running in the current thread.
  Applies only when --execute is provided.

.. warning::
    Pipelines are added and are executed in order.


`$ scanpipe list-project [--search SEARCH] [--include-archived]`
----------------------------------------------------------------

Lists ScanPipe projects.

Optional arguments:

- ``--search SEARCH`` Limit the projects list to this search results.

- ``--include-archived`` Include archived projects.

.. tip::
    Only the project names are listed by default. You can display more details
    about each project by providing the ``--verbosity 2`` or ``--verbosity 3``
    options.


`$ scanpipe add-input --project PROJECT [--input-file FILES] [--input-url URLS]`
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Adds input files in the project's work directory.

- ``--input-file INPUTS_FILES`` Input file locations to copy in the :guilabel:`input/`
  work directory.

- ``--input-url INPUT_URLS`` Input URLs to download in the :guilabel:`input/` work
  directory.

For example, assuming you have created beforehand a project named "foo", this will
copy ``~/docker/alpine-base.tar`` to the foo project :guilabel:`input/` directory::

    $ scanpipe add-input --project foo --input-file ~/docker/alpine-base.tar

.. warning::
    Make sure to mount your local sources volume in the Docker setup:

    ``--volume /host/sources:/sources:ro --input-file /sources/image.tar``

You can also provide URLs of files to be downloaded to the foo project
:guilabel:`input/` directory::

    $ scanpipe add-input --project foo --input-url https://github.com/nexB/scancode.io-tutorial/releases/download/sample-images/30-alpine-nickolashkraus-staticbox-latest.tar

.. note:: Docker images can be provided as input using their Docker reference
    with the ``docker://docker-reference`` syntax. For example::

    $ [...] --input-url docker://redis
    $ [...] --input-url docker://postgres:13
    $ [...] --input-url docker://docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-oss:7.10.2

See https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/ for more details about
references.


`$ scanpipe add-pipeline --project PROJECT PIPELINE_NAME [PIPELINE_NAME ...]`
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Adds the ``PIPELINE_NAME`` to a given ``PROJECT``.
You can use more than one ``PIPELINE_NAME`` to add multiple pipelines at once.

.. warning::
    Pipelines are added and are executed in order.

For example, assuming you have created beforehand a project named "foo", this will
add the docker pipeline to your project::

    $ scanpipe add-pipeline --project foo docker

`$ scanpipe create-user <username>`
-----------------------------------

.. note:: This command is to be used when ScanCode.io's authentication system
  :ref:`scancodeio_settings_require_authentication` is enabled.

Creates a user and generates an API key for authentication.

You will be prompted for a password. After you enter one, the user will be created
immediately.

The API key for the new user account will be displayed on the terminal output.

By default, this command will prompt for a password for the new user account.
When run non-interactively with the ``--no-input`` option, no password will be set,
and the user account will only be able to authenticate with the REST API using its
API key.
