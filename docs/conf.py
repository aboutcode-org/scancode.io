# Configuration file for the Sphinx documentation builder.

# This file only contains a selection of the most common options. For a full
# list see the documentation:

# -- Path setup --------------------------------------------------------------

# If extensions (or modules to document with autodoc) are in another directory,
# add these directories to sys.path here. If the directory is relative to the
# documentation root, use os.path.abspath to make it absolute, like shown here.

# -- Project information -----------------------------------------------------

project = "ScanCode.io"
copyright = "nexB Inc."
author = "nexB Inc."


# -- General configuration ---------------------------------------------------

# Add any Sphinx extension module names here, as strings. They can be
# extensions coming with Sphinx (named "sphinx.ext.*") or your custom
# ones.
extensions = [
    "sphinx.ext.autodoc",
    "sphinxcontrib_django2",
]

# Add any paths that contain templates here, relative to this directory.

# List of patterns, relative to source directory, that match files and
# directories to ignore when looking for source files.
# This pattern also affects html_static_path and html_extra_path.
exclude_patterns = ["_build", "Thumbs.db", ".DS_Store"]


# -- Autodoc -----------------------------------------------------------------

# The default options for autodoc directives.
# They are applied to all autodoc directives automatically.
# It must be a dictionary which maps option names to the values.
autodoc_default_options = {
    # Keep the source code order for the autodoc content, as we want to keep
    # the processing order for the Pipelines doc.

# -- Options for HTML output -------------------------------------------------

# The theme to use for HTML and HTML Help pages.  See the documentation for
# a list of builtin themes.
html_theme = "sphinx_rtd_theme"

# Add any paths that contain custom static files (such as style sheets) here,
# relative to this directory. They are copied after the builtin static files,
# so a file named "default.css" will overwrite the builtin "default.css".
