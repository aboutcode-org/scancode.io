  VulnerableCode database for all project discovered packages.
  Vulnerability data is stored in the extra_data field of each package.
  More details about VulnerableCode at https://github.com/nexB/vulnerablecode/
  https://github.com/nexB/scancode.io/issues/101

- Add a new "inspect manifest" pipeline to resolve packages from manifest, lockfile,
  and SBOM. The resolved packages are created as discovered packages.
  Support PyPI "requirements.txt" files, SPDX document as JSON ".spdx.json",
  and AboutCode ".ABOUT" files.
  https://github.com/nexB/scancode.io/issues/284

  https://github.com/nexB/scancode.io/issues/389

- Display Webhook status in the Run modal.
  The WebhookSubscription model was refined to capture delivery data.
  https://github.com/nexB/scancode.io/issues/389

- Display the current active step of a running pipeline in the "Pipeline" section of
  the project details view, inside the run status tag.
  https://github.com/nexB/scancode.io/issues/300

- Add proper pagination for API actions: resources, packages, dependencies, and errors.

- Refine the fields ordering in API Serializers based on the toolkit order.
  https://github.com/nexB/scancode.io/issues/546

- Keep the current filters state when submitting a search in list views.
  https://github.com/nexB/scancode.io/issues/541

- Improve the performances of the project details view to load faster by deferring the
  the charts rendering. This is especially noticeable on projects with a large amount
  of codebase resources and discovered packages.
  https://github.com/nexB/scancode.io/issues/193

- Add support for filtering by "Other" values when filtering from the charts in the
  Project details view.
  https://github.com/nexB/scancode.io/issues/526

- ``CodebaseResource.for_packages`` now returns a list of
  ``DiscoveredPackage.package_uid`` or ``DiscoveredPackage.package_url`` if
  ``DiscoveredPackage.package_uid`` is not present. This is done to reflect the
  how scancode-toolkit's JSON output returns ``package_uid``s in the
  ``for_packages`` field for Resources.

- Add the model DiscoveredDependency. This represents Package dependencies
  discovered in a Project. The ``scan_codebase`` and ``scan_packages`` pipelines
  have been updated to create DiscoveredDepdendency objects. The Project API has
  been updated with new fields:

  - ``dependency_count``
    - The number of DiscoveredDependencies associated with the project.

  - ``discovered_dependencies_summary``
    - A mapping that contains following fields:

      - ``total``
        - The number of DiscoveredDependencies associated with the project.
      - ``is_runtime``
        - The number of runtime dependencies.
      - ``is_optional``
        - The number of optional dependencies.
      - ``is_resolved``
        - The number of resolved dependencies.

  These values are also available on the Project view.
  https://github.com/nexB/scancode.io/issues/447

- The ``dependencies`` field has been removed from the DiscoveredPackage model.

- Create directory CodebaseResources in the rootfs pipeline.
  https://github.com/nexB/scancode.io/issues/515

- Add ProjectErrors when the DiscoveredPackage could not be fetched using the
  provided `package_uid` during the `assemble_package` step instead of failing the whole
  pipeline.
  https://github.com/nexB/scancode.io/issues/525

- Escape paths before using them in regular expressions in ``CodebaseResource.walk()``.
  https://github.com/nexB/scancode.io/issues/525

- Disable multiprocessing and threading by default on macOS ("spawn" start method).
  https://github.com/nexB/scancode.io/issues/522

v31.0.0 (2022-08-25)
--------------------

- WARNING: Drop support for Python 3.6 and 3.7. Add support for Python 3.10.
  Upgrade Django to version 4.1 series.

  See https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.rst for an
  overview of the changes in the v31 compared to v30.

- Implement run status auto-refresh using the htmx JavaScript library.
  The statuses of queued and running pipeline are now automatically refreshed
  in the project list and project details views every 10 seconds.
  A new "toast" type of notification is displayed along the status update.
  https://github.com/nexB/scancode.io/issues/390

- Ensure the worker service waits for migrations completion before starting.
  To solve this issue we install the wait-for-it script available in
  Debian by @vishnubob and as suggested in the Docker documentation.
  In the docker-compose.yml, we let the worker wait for the web processing
  to be complete when gunicorn exposes port 8000 and web container is available.
  Reference: https://docs.docker.com/compose/startup-order/
  Reference: https://github.com/vishnubob/wait-for-it

v30.1.0 (2021-11-22)
--------------------

- Synchronize QUEUED and RUNNING pipeline runs with their related worker jobs during
  worker maintenance tasks scheduled every 10 minutes.
  If a container was taken down while a pipeline was running, or if pipeline process
  was killed unexpectedly, that pipeline run status will be updated to a FAILED state
  during the next maintenance tasks.
  QUEUED pipeline will be restored in the queue as the worker redis cache backend data
  is now persistent and reloaded on starting the image.
  Note that internaly, a running job emits a "heartbeat" every 60 seconds to let all the
  workers know that it is properly running.
  After 90 seconds without any heartbeats, a worker will determine that the job is not
  active anymore and that job will be moved to the failed registry during the worker
  maintenance tasks. The pipeline run will be updated as well to reflect this failure
  in the Web UI, the REST API, and the command line interface.
  https://github.com/nexB/scancode.io/issues/130
