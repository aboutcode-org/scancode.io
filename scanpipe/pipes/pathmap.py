"""
Path matching using Aho-Corasick automatons.

The approach is to create a trie of all reversed path suffixes aka. subpath each
mapped to a tuple of:
    (subpath length, [list of path ids]).

And then search this index using Aho-Corasick search.

For instance with this list of path ids and paths:

    1    RouterStub.java
    23   samples/screenshot.png
    3    samples/JGroups/src/RouterStub.java
    42   src/screenshot.png

We will create this list of inverted subpaths:

    RouterStub.java
    screenshot.png
    screenshot.png/samples
    RouterStub.java/JGroups/src/samples
    RouterStub.java/JGroups/src
    RouterStub.java/JGroups
    RouterStub.java
    screenshot.png
    screenshot.png/src

And we will have this index:

    inverted path -> (number of segments, [list of path ids])
    RouterStub.java -> (1, [1, 3])
    screenshot.png -> (1, [23, 42])
    screenshot.png/samples -> (2, [23])
    RouterStub.java/JGroups/src/samples -> (4, [3])
    RouterStub.java/JGroups/src -> (3, [3])
    RouterStub.java/JGroups -> (3, [3])
    screenshot.png/src -> (2, [42])
