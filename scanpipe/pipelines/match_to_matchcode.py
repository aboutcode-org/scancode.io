class MatchToMatchCode(Pipeline):
    """
    Match the codebase resources of a project against MatchCode.io to identify packages.

    This process involves:

    1. Generating a JSON scan of the project codebase
    2. Transmitting it to MatchCode.io and awaiting match results
    3. Creating discovered packages from the package data obtained
    4. Associating the codebase resources with those discovered packages

    Currently, MatchCode.io can only match for archives, directories, and files
    from Maven and npm Packages.

    This pipeline requires a MatchCode.io instance to be configured and available.
    There is currently no public instance of MatchCode.io. Reach out to nexB, Inc.
    for other arrangements.
