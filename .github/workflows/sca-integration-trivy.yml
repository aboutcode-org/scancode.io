name: Generate SBOM with Trivy and load into ScanCode.io

# This workflow:
#  1. Generates a CycloneDX SBOM for a container image using Trivy.
#  2. Uploads the SBOM as a GitHub artifact for future inspection.
#  3. Loads the SBOM into ScanCode.io for further analysis.
#  4. Runs assertions to verify that the SBOM was properly processed in ScanCode.io.
#
# It runs on demand, and once a week (scheduled).
